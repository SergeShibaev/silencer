Silencer
========

Silencer's goal is blocking all nasty intrusive callers. 
In the 1st private version it blocks some global numbers like:
- from Estonian code +372
- from all hiden undefined numbers
- from all numbers not included in the Contact List (in Silence time from 00:00 to 09:59)
- block all incoming messages from black list numbers
